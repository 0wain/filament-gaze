### `->pollTimer($timeInSecs)`

#### Description
`polltimer` can be used to set how often the browser should inform Filament that the use is still viewing the page, along with getting an updated list of other users. It is advised not to put this value too short, as it can cause rate limiting issues. But also not to have this value too long, as it will result in a delayed update of new users viewing the page.

#### Arguments
`timeInSeconds` - (int) The amount of time in seconds between each poll. Default is 30 seconds.

### `->identifier($name)`

#### Description
`identifier` is used as a unique identifier for this gaze banner. Any other gaze banners with the same identifier will share the same list of active users. This can be useful if you want 2 difference resources to share the same list of active viewing users.

#### Arguments
`name` - (string) The name of the identifier. Default is the resource's model class combines with model Id.
